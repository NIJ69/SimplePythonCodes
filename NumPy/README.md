**In this folder, I have listed the resources I used to learn NumPy.**

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

At the core of the NumPy package, is the "ndarray" object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.

- [Official NumPy website](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html): This is the official NumPy modules explanation website. Here you can find everything you need to master NumPy with example codes.

- [W3School's Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)

- [Array Visualization](https://github.com/tom-draper/array-3d-viz): This is a GitHub repository of a web-app to visualize 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D array. The app is hosted on [this](https://array-3d-viz.vercel.app/) website. Look at the pictures of the 3 arrays of different dimensions to understand how they are plotted. Anything interesting?ðŸ¤”?
