**In this folder, I have listed the resources I used to learn NumPy.**

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

At the core of the NumPy package, is the "ndarray" object. This encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types, with many operations being performed in compiled code for performance.
